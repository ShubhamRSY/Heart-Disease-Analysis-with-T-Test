# Heart Disease Analysis with T-Test

## Project Overview
This project focuses on statistical analysis of heart rate data from individuals diagnosed with heart disease. By applying a t-test, we evaluate whether the maximum heart rate achieved differs significantly from the general average, offering insights that are crucial for understanding cardiovascular conditions.

## Repository Contents
- `hearth_disease_analys.`: Jupyter notebook with detailed analysis, including code and visualizations.
- `cardiac_data.csv`: Dataset containing cardiovascular features such as maximum heart rate.
- `vgsales.csv`: Additional dataset included for comparative analysis purposes.

## Statistical Analysis
### Hypothesis Testing
- **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: The average maximum heart rate achieved is the same between the overall population and a specific sample.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: The average maximum heart rate achieved differs between the overall population and the specific sample.

### Methodology
The analysis involves the following steps:
1. Data Cleaning: Preprocessing the data to handle missing values and outliers.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing the data to understand trends and patterns.
3. T-Test Execution: Conducting a t-test to statistically test the hypotheses.
